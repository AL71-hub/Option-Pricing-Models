    "1. The objective is to determine the value of a European call option on tech company Tesla. Although the current stock price is €200, the option gives the ability to purchase Tesla shares at a strike price of €210 within six months. We make the assumptions that there will be no dividends paid during the option's term, a constantly compounding risk-free rate of 2%, and an annual volatility (constant) of 25%. \n",

It offers a rapid analytical solution, widely adopted as a benchmark by the markets, and enables the theoretical price of the Tesla call to be calculated rigorously and transparently. Furthermore, it’s an easy way to implement the BSM via Python tools.  "
